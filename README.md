# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in C++. I aim to solve problems daily, improve my coding skills, and document my journey.

## Problems

| #   | Title        | Solution                   | Topics          | Date       |
|-----|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1   | Two Sum      | [Two_Sum.cpp](Two_Sum.cpp) | Array, Hash Map | 2025-03-13 |
| 2   | Palindrome Number | [Palindrome_Number.cpp](Palindrome_Number.cpp) | Math            | 2025-03-13 | 
## How I Organize
- Each problem solution is stored in a `.cpp` file named after the problem (e.g., `Two_Sum.cpp`).
- Problems are listed in the table above with links to the solution files.
- Topics indicate the main concepts used in the solution.

## Goals
- Solve at least 1 problem per day.
- Review past problems weekly to solidify concepts.
- Explore various data structures and algorithms.
